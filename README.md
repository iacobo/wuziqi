## About

A simple Wuziqi game for android (aka [Gomoku / Connect 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku)).

- play with a friend or challenge the computer
- design your own custom games
- discover an ~easter egg~ or two ü•öüêá

Completely FOSS - no ads, no trackers, nothing unnecessary. Just a clean, offline, 2-player boardgame app.

## How to play

Players take turns placing their stones on the grid. The first player to place 5 of their colour in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
